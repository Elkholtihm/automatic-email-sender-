# Automatic email sender

## Overview

This repository contains a Python-based application that automates the process of sending job or internship applications via email. It leverages the Gmail API for email delivery, integrates with a Telegram bot for user interaction, and uses an LLM (Language Learning Model) to compose the emails based on job descriptions.

## Features

1. **Automated Email Generation:** Uses an LLM to draft professional internship/job application emails based on job descriptions.
2. **Email Attachments:** Automatically attaches a resume (PDF format) and provides a GitHub link.
3. **Telegram Bot Integration:** Enables users to interact with the application via Telegram commands.
4. **Gmail API Integration:** Sends emails through authenticated Gmail accounts.
5. **Dockerized Deployment:** The project can be containerized and easily deployed using Docker.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
- A Gmail account with API access enabled
- Ngrok (optional, for exposing the local server during development)
- Telegram Bot API Token

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Elkholtihm/automatic-email-sender-.git
   cd automatic-email-sender-
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure you have `pip` installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Setup Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file and add the following variables:
   ```plaintext
    # Telegram Bot Token
    BOT_TOKEN=<you're bot token>
    
    # Groq API Key
    GROQ_KEY=<youre groq_key>
    
    # Sender Email Address
    SENDER_EMAIL=<youew email you wil use to send>
    
    # Gmail API Credentials and Token Paths
    CREDENTIALS_FILE=credentials_local.json
    TOKEN_FILE=token.json
   ```

4. **Setup Gmail API:**
   - Obtain your credentials JSON file from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Save it as `credentials_local.json` in the root directory.
   - Run the script once to authenticate and generate `token.json`.

5. **Run the Application Locally:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Expose the Server Using Ngrok (Optional):**
   ```bash
   ./ngrok.exe http 5000
   ```

7. **Containerize the Application:**
   Build and run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker build -t <image_name> .
   docker run -p 5000:5000 --env-file .env -v <path_to_>/credentials_local.json -v <path_to>\token.json:/app/token.json <image_name>
   ```

## How It Works

1. **Telegram Bot Interaction:**
   - The user sends a job description and the destination email to the bot.
   - The bot triggers the LLM to generate the email content and subject.

2. **Email Composition:**
   - The `bot.py` script uses the Gmail API to send the email with the following:
     - A custom email body generated by the LLM.
     - Attachments (e.g., resume PDF).
     - A GitHub profile link.

3. **Delivery:**
   - The email is sent through the authenticated Gmail account.
